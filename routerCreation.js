 * routerCreation: Function: takes in three arguments and returns and instance of an express.Router. The user would then save the returned result as a variable to use in their GraphQL/Express server to route all REST requests through.
 * @param {Object} manifest: Created by the user. The first key of the manifest object should be 'endpoints'. See the webiste to create your own manifest object easily or look at the readMe on the Github repo for how to format the manifest object properly.
 * @param {Object} createdGQL: Output from the function queryMap.
 * @param {Object} infoForExecution: Has three keys:
 * {
 *     schema: GQL Schema
 *     context: Object, or a Function that returns an object: this is passed to the executeFn for the GraphQL resolvers. Here the function passes in the req.headers from the request object as 'headers' so the resolvers have access to the headers for any authorization needs.
 *      executeFn: Function: this is a wrapped function created by the user that will return the response from your GraphQL/Express server. Have the function return the GraphQL response object in it's entirety. The wrapped function will accept one object that will have four keys:
 *      {
 *          query: String: specific query/mutation from the object outputted by queryMap,
 *          variables: Object or Null: all necessary variables from the request object, if no variables are required, passed in or no defaultParams are defined in the manifest object, the variables value will be null,
 *          schema: GQL Schema: passed into infoForExecution object,
 *          context: Object: this was initally passed into routerCreation's infoForExecution object as either a Function that returns an object or an Object plainly. routerCreation will pass the request object's headers into the context object with the key of 'headers' for the resolvers to have access to.
 *      }
 * }
 *
 * @returns an instance of an express.Router() populated with all the REST API paths that the user defined in the manifest object.
